# BoulderCountPrediction
Using the K-Means Clustering method on ANFO and SME datasets, we aim at developing a model for the prediction of the boulder count in Quarry Blasting.
First we classify the dataset into 2 clusters each for ANFO and SME and then apply Linear Regression on each of the clusters. 
However Linear Regression model is not included in this repo.
